### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software development manager at AWS.  I've helped build ðŸ”¨ several large services within AWS to provide networking and storage services to EC2 customers.  These days I'm focused on the development of a new Machine Learning offering called [Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/).  Inferentia is useful for inference, but you'll need the [AWS Neuron SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk).

ðŸ¤” Want to help with [AWS Neuron SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk)? 
ðŸ“« Cool.  Reach out or start by providing some feedback on the project.
